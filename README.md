TowerDefGen
===========

TowerDefGen is a program that allows artists to draw assets for tower defense games without writing any code. Out-of-the-box, it provides a GUI for the artist to select the files required for the game, and to define various types of game objects. The artist can draw levels, towers, enemies, and projectiles in a separate program such as [GIMP][] or [Photoshop][], and then save them as `png` images for use in the game. Audio producers can also create background music (as `ogg` files) and short clips (as `wav` files) that will be included in the game as well.

TowerDefGen doesn't simply replace resources in a pre-built `jar` file. Instead, it generates the required Java code at runtime, then compiles and builds it with [Apache Ant][]. If desired, programmers can join with the artists to create more versatile game object types. The code generated by TowerDefGen is built on the [JGame][] library, so beginning CS students familiar with JGame will have no trouble working with TowerDefGen.

TowerDefGen has the following dependencies (included in the jar file):

 * `ant.jar`
 * `ant-launcher.jar`
 * `c2.jar`
 * `miglayout-4.0-swing.jar`
 * `tools.jar` (for `javac`)
